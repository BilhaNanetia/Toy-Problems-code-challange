 # Calculator Programs
 ## Introduction
 This project includes three programs that perform several calculations and give output depending on the user's input values.
 ### 1.Students grades generator
 This program prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then outputs the correct grade to the user:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.
### 2.Speed Detector Program
This program takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
### 3. Net Salary Calculator Program
This program calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.It calculates the payee (Tax) based on the KRA Tax Rates.It also calculates the NHIF and NSSF deductions based on the NHIF and NSSF rates.It computes the gross salary (basic salary + benefits) and then calculates the net salary (gross salary - payee - NHIF and NSSF deductions).The program then displays the Net Salary to the user.
